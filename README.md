# Github Portfolio
##### By Bryan Karaffa

Generates a nice looking portfolio using recent GitHub activity. This is what you will see when you visit [BryanKaraffa.com](//bryankaraffa.com) 

## TODO

 - If file_exists("card_images/$repo_fullName.png"), use that as the card image.  This will be useful for adding a card image to repos that we do not own or want to add a screenshot.png to.
 - "Always On" repositories.  These repos will always display.  If they aren't in the recent activity feed, they will be added to the bottom.
